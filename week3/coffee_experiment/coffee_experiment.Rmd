# Description

Note: This is adapted from a discussion by David Spiegelhalter.

In March of 2018 there was a [court case in California](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2018/03/29/coffee-must-carry-cancer-warning-california-judge-rules/) that hinged on whether a chemical called acrylamide found in coffee causes cancer.

The judge asked the defendants to show that coffee was "safe" in that drinking coffee caused fewer than 1 in 100,000 extra cases of cancer. The defendants were unable to demonstrate this. As a result, companies selling coffee in California must now display a cancer warning alongside it.

Imagine you were the defendants and wanted to set up a randomized experiment to demonstrate that coffee is indeed "safe" and causes fewer than 1 in 100,000 extra cases of cancer. Assuming the lifetime risk of getting cancer is 40%, this means that your experiment would have to tell the difference between 40,000 out of 100,000 non-coffee drinkers getting cancer versus 40,001 out of 100,000 coffee drinkers getting cancer.

# Part A

Assuming you could actually pull of such an experiment, how many participants would you need to reject the null hypothesis that fewer than 1 in 100,000 extra cases of cancer occur among people assigned to drink coffee? 

For the sake of the calculation assume you'd like to have the following long-run error rates. If coffee is indeed "safe", you'd like your test to falsely return "unsafe" at most 1 in 10 times. If, however, coffee is "unsafe", you'd like your test to detect this effect 4 out of 5 times.

You can use one of R's built-in power functions to calculate an answer.

```{r power-calc}

pa <- 40000/100000
pb <- 40001/100000

power.prop.test(p1= pa, p2=pb, sig.level=0.10, power=0.80, alternative="two.sided")

```

# Part B

=> In order to tell the difference between those proportions, the sample size has to be extremely large which is actually practically impossible given the population of the earth.
